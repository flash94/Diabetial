    <string name="bestfoods"><BIG><b>Best and Worst Foods for Diabetes:</b></BIG> \n\n  <b>      1)  MaterialDateTimePicker
        </b> \n\n<TT>
Your food choices matter a lot when you've got diabetes.Some are better than others.
Nothing is completely off-limits. Even items that you might think of as “the worst" could be occasional treats -- in tiny amounts. But they won’t help you nutrition-wise, and it’s easiest to manage your diabetes if you mainly stick to the “best” options.
.</TT>\n\n\n

        <BIG><b>1. Starches:</b></BIG> \n\n <TT>
                            Your body needs carbs. But you want to choose wisely. Use this list as a guide.\n\n

                          <b>Best Choices</b>  \n\n

                                Whole grains, such as brown rice, oatmeal, quinoa, millet, or amaranth
                                Baked sweet potato\n\n
                                Items made with whole grains and no (or very little) added sugar\n\n

                           <b>Worst Choices</b> \n\n

                                Processed grains, such as white rice or white flour
                                Cereals with little whole grains and lots of sugar\n\n
                                White bread,
                                French fries,
                                Fried white-flour tortilla.</TT>\n\n\n


       <BIG><b>2.Vegetables</b></BIG>  \n\n <TT>

Load up! You’ll get fiber and very little fat or salt (unless you add them).  Remember, potatoes and corn count as carbs.

<b>Best Choices</b>  \n\n

    1. Fresh veggies, eaten raw or lightly steamed, roasted, or grilled\n\n
    2. Plain frozen vegetables, lightly steamed\n\n
    3. Greens such as kale, spinach, and arugula. Iceberg lettuce is not as great because it’s low in nutrients.\n\n
    4. Low sodium or unsalted canned vegetables \n\n

Go for a variety of colors: dark greens, red or orange (think of carrots or red peppers), whites (onions) and even purple (eggplants). The 2015 U.S. guidelines recommend 2.5 cups of veggies per day.\n\n

<b>Worst Choices</b> \n\n

    1. Canned vegetables with lots of added sodium\n\n
    2. Veggies cooked with lots of added butter, cheese, or sauce\n\n
    3. Pickles, if you need to limit sodium. Otherwise, pickles are OK.\n\n
   4.  Sauerkraut, for the same reason as pickles. Limit them if you have high blood pressure.</TT>\n\n\n


<BIG><b>3.Fruits</b></BIG>  \n\n <TT>

They give you carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Most are naturally low in fat and sodium. But they tend to have more carbs than vegetables do.\n\n

<b>Best Choices</b>  \n\n

    1. Fresh fruit\n\n
    2. Plain frozen fruit or fruit canned without added sugar\n\n
   3.  Sugar-free or low-sugar jam or preserves\n\n
    4. No-sugar-added applesauce\n\n

<b>Worst Choices</b> \n\n

    1. Canned fruit with heavy sugar syrup\n\n
   2.  Chewy fruit rolls\n\n
    3. Regular jam, jelly, and preserves (unless you have a very small portion)\n\n
    4. Sweetened applesauce\n\n
    Fruit punch, fruit drinks, fruit juice drinks</TT>\n\n\n

<BIG><b>4.PROTEIN</b></BIG>  \n\n <TT>
You have lots of choices, including beef, chicken, fish, pork, turkey, seafood, beans, cheese, eggs, nuts, and tofu.\n\n

<b>Best Choices</b>  \n\n

The American Diabetes Association lists these as the top options:\n\n

    1. Plant-based proteins such as beans, nuts, seeds, or tofu\n\n
    2. Fish and seafood\n\n
    3. Chicken and other poultry (Choose the breast meat if possible.)\n\n
    4. Eggs and low-fat dairy\n\n

If you eat meat, keep it low in fat. Trim the skin off of poultry.\n\n

Try to include some plant-based protein from beans, nuts, or tofu, even if you're not a vegetarian or vegan. You’ll get nutrients and fiber that aren’t in animal products.\n\n

<b>Worst Choices</b> \n\n

    1. Fried meats\n\n
   2.  Higher-fat cuts of meat, such as ribs\n\n
    3. Pork bacon\n\n
    4. Regular cheeses\n\n
    5. Poultry with skin\n\n
    6. Deep-fried fish\n\n
    7. Deep-fried tofu\n\n
    8. Beans prepared with lard</TT>\n\n\n


<BIG><b>5. Drinks:</b></BIG> \n\n <TT>

When you down a favorite drink, you may get more calories, sugar, salt, or fat than you bargained for. Read the labels so you know what’s in a serving.\n\n

<b>Best Choices</b>  \n\n

    Unflavored water or flavored sparkling water\n\n
    Unsweetened tea with or without a slice of lemon\n\n
    Light beer, small amounts of wine, or non-fruity mixed drinks\n\n
    Coffee, black or with added low-fat milk and sugar substitute\n\n

<b>Worst Choices</b> \n\n

    Regular sodas\n\n
    Regular beer, fruity mixed drinks, dessert wines\n\n
    Sweetened tea\n\n
    Coffee with sugar and cream\n\n
    Flavored coffees and chocolate drinks\n\n
    Energy drinks</TT>\n\n\n

    <string name="bestexcercise"><BIG><b> Quick Tips for Working Out</b></BIG> \n\n <TT>



Anything that gets your heart pumping and makes you break a sweat will do.
You don’t need a health club membership or personal trainer.
And here’s a little secret: You don’t have to do 30 minutes all at once.
Ten minutes in the morning, 10 minutes in the afternoon, and 10 minutes after dinner is just fine.</TT>\n\n


                          <BIG><b>Work Out Tips for You</b></BIG>  \n\n
        <b>Top 10 Tips for You</b>  \n\n

    1. Walk the dog. If you don’t have a pet, walk with a   friend or neighbor. \n\n
    2. Rake leaves, mow the lawn, or dig in the dirt to clean up your garden.\n\n
    3. Play tag with your children or grandchildren.\n\n
    4. Ballroom dance. You can also take dance lessons -- modern, ballet, or hip-hop.\n\n
    5. Roller skate. It burns about 225 calories per hour and uses muscles that may be rusty.\n\n
    6. Play tennis or any team sport. You’ll make some new friends and stay active.\n\n
    7. Swim. It's a great total body workout and helps you relax. It’s also a low-impact workout that is easy on your joints.\n\n
    8. Take an evening after-dinner walk. Walking at the end of day can help you unwind and feel less stressed after a busy day. \n\n
    9. Wash your car or clean the house. Even if you get your closets in order instead of doing a deep cleaning, you’re still moving.\n\n

<BIG><b>Try to sneak activity into your day when and where you can</b></BIG>

    When doing work around the house, pump up some fun music and make all your movements bigger. Squat while you work: Bend from the hips and knees like you're sitting down in a chair. Make sure your knees don't go farther forward than your toes.\n\n
    Take the stairs instead of the elevator. If you’re going to a high floor, get off a couple of floors below and climb the rest of the way.\n\n
    Don't call or email your colleagues at work. Walk over to a co-worker’s desk for a face-to-face.\n\n
    Walk or pace when you're on the phone, at home, or at work.\n\n
    Park your car at the far end of the parking lot. And bring your bags out to the car after every purchase.\n\n
